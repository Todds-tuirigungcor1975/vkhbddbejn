Bro, I just staggered out of the theater, head spinning like that time I tried to bench press after a double serving of pre-workout (bad idea, trust me). Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare, man, it was like if fairy tales took steroids but forgot leg day. I'm still trying to piece it all together, like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces made of popcorn and emotions.

First off, let me tell you, the theater was chaos, pure chaos, like a gym during New Year's resolution week. People everywhere, chatter, crumbs sticking to my shirt, and my back, dude, it was like sitting on a barbell. But anyway, the  ... the colors! Everything was so loud, like eating a rainbow that yells at you. I swear at some point, I forgot if I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a   or living in some 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed-out dream. Tinkerbell looked like she could beat you in an arm wrestling contest without breaking a sweat. 

Captain Hook, man, was he a pirate or a life coach gone rogue? His hook was glinting like my biceps after a good pump. Like seriously, you'd almost want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 his scenes again, see if you can catch what’s being injected in his character... or his veins.

> At one point, I swear Wendy started sounding like my old training partner, Jeff, telling me I could deadlift twice my body weight if only I 'believed hard enough.' And those Lost Boys... felt like they’d been on a serious bulk, but kept all their enthusiasm in their arms — flailing everywhere with youthful chaos.

The fight scenes were like someone set Cirque du Soleil on fire and added swords. Wild. A lady behind me sneezed during a tense moment, and you’d think she triggered a special effect — half the audience jumped. Seriously, try not to sneeze near a pixie; things might explode or grow new muscles.

Neverland wasn't how I remembered it. Felt more like a UFC ring with pixie dust everywhere. The crocodile — machine. Huge! Like an aquatic beast that moonlights as a strongman. You know, I really think somehow the   had a hidden bicep curl challenge in it. Seriously felt my arms twitching every time a character flexed. 

Oh! Yeah, by the way, need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   later again, some scenes need a re-evaluation with a clearer mind or post-leg day zen. I swear the popcorn had extra butter but also a sprinkle of mystery.
